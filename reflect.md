# What I Learned
- I learned that game development, even for simple games is not easy. A lot of the times the UI updates are closely linked with the game logic, so managing the two was an interesting challenge. 
- I also learned it makes sense to have a solid plan before coding, since the planning phase usually determines how smoothly the implementation phase will go. 
- Sometimes in theory it seems simple to implement something, but when actually attempting to do it, it can feel daunting to start. 

# Challenges
- The main challenge was in organizing the game's scenarios and states in a way that made sense. 
- I often tried to do too much at once when I should've iteratively added more and more features using a basic templates. 
- This led to a lot of refactoring for me as I didn't have the most efficient way of building upon previous versions. 

# Managing Complexity
- I attempted to tackle this by starting out as small as possible, first just moving players across the board before being adding in more details.
- By ensuring I had the core game mechanics handled first, I was able to add more rules as I saw them fit.
- I also started out by focusing on the setup of the game/board before anything else.

# Final Product
- My game is pretty simple so I think the final product does closely match what I had intended.
- In retrospect, adding more animations for glass panels shattering, or players moving across the screen might have been good.

# Using AI
- I did use ChatGPT as an assistant for this project. It was definitely not as easy I initially had hoped.
- Sometimes the model didn't quite understand what I wanted to do for certain aspects of the game, and I had to make sure to give lots of examples to slowly build up its understanding.
- The one thing it was good at was reviewing code for obvious or glaring bugs.
