# Code Explanation

## `startGame()`

The `startGame()` function is the entry point for the game's lifecycle, initiating a new game state. It starts by capturing the player count and bridge length from the user input, using `parseInt` to ensure the values are treated as integers. The game state variables are then reset to their defaults, including the timer, players array, bridge array, current player index, and game-over flag. Players are initialized with a `for` loop, creating an object for each player with default properties like position, lane, and activity status. The bridge is also set up with a `for` loop, assigning a random 'safe' side (left or right) for each segment, represented by an object with properties for each side and a discovery flag. After setting up the game state, the setup view is hidden, the game view is displayed, and the UI is updated with `updateUI()`. Finally, the game timer is started with `startTimer()`.

## `updateUI()`

`updateUI()` is called to synchronize the game's visual representation with its internal state. It performs a series of DOM manipulations to reflect the current situation in the game. Each section of the game (alive players, start area, bridge, finish area, and dead players) is updated. Alive players are color-coded and listed in their designated area. The start and finish areas are populated with player elements representing their positions. The bridge is rendered with panels, and players are positioned accordingly, utilizing the `createPanel()` helper function to generate the appropriate DOM elements. Each player's element is styled with a unique hue based on their index, providing a consistent color scheme across the game. The current player's turn is also updated in the UI. The function ensures that the displayed state matches the game's internal logic after any changes, such as player movements or game progression.

## `move()`

The `move()` function handles the logic when a player decides to move left or right on the bridge. It first checks if the game has ended, and if not, it retrieves the current player's state. If the player is active, their position is incremented, indicating a move onto the bridge. If they reach the end of the bridge, they're marked as finished. If they step onto a tempered panel, they are deactivated (representing a fall), and the panel is marked as discovered. After handling the move, the UI is updated with `updateUI()`. The function then checks if the game is over with `checkGameOver()`. If the game continues, it proceeds to the next player with `nextPlayer()`. This function is a critical part of the game's turn-based mechanics, processing each move's consequences and advancing the game state accordingly.
