Title: Glass Bridge Game

Target Platform: Desktop

Genre: Strategy 

Objective: Players must try to cross a bridge where at each step they can choose the left or the right panel. Only one of these panels is safe, and stepping on the other will result in a Game Over.
Rules of the Game: Players go in order to cross the bridge and at each step can go left, right, or skip their turn. There is a timer so that if it expires everyone who has not reached the safe zone dies. Eventually, I will add a rule so that only the first 3 players to successfuly cross survive.

Game Mechanics: The only choices a player can make are to cross left, right, or skip. If they choose a dangerous panel, they automatically die and can no longer play the game.

This game is based on an episode of the show "Squid Game".
