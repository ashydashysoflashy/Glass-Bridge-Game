# Title: 
Glass Bridge Game

# Target Platform: 
Desktop

# Genre: 
Strategy, Games of Chance

# Objective: 
Players must try to cross a two-column bridge where at each step only one of these panels is safe, and stepping on the other will result in a Game Over for that player. One panel is made of regular glass, and the other is made of tempered glass.

# Rules of the Game: 
Players go in order to cross the bridge and at each step can go left, right, or skip their turn. 

There is a timer so that if it expires everyone who has not reached the safe zone dies. 

Only the first 3 players to reach the safe zonde can win.

The game is over either when 1: the timer runs out, 2: 3 players have reached the safe-zone, or 3: all players are either dead or have reached the safe zone.

# Game Mechanics: 
The only choices a player can make are to cross left, right, or skip. 

If they choose a dangerous panel, they automatically die and can no longer play the game.

This game is based on an episode of the show "Squid Game".
